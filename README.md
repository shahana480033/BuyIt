### Project Description
This website aims to promote sustainability through MNC's and consumers. THe website acts as a platform for products where we assign a rating of 5 stars in the categories of-Health, Sustainability, Durability, Practicality and Quality. We offer our rating along with an increase in the price of their product in the market if the product recieves a good rating. The users will then be able to chose the more better product, and companies would recieve their share of the profit margin.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
To build a strong sense of assurance to the users certifying the validity of the rating. 


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
To perhaps advertise the website and promote it through consumer satisfaction.
